HIGH LEVEL
------------
1. Open both directories and check all of the files in syncidir with maindir
2. If file in syncdir and not in maindir, then delete file in syncdir
3. If file in maindir and not in syncdir, then copy file from maindir into syncdir
4. If file exists in both, then check modification time, and copy file most recently modified from x directory into
y directory



while (syncDir != NULL){

    file_syncdir ;
    bool found = False ; 

    while mainDir( != NULL ) {

        if (file_syncdir == file_maindir){
            found = True ; 
        
        mainDir -> next ;
    
    if found == true {
        compare_creation_times(file_syncdir, file_maindir) ;
            if (file_syncdir newer than file_maindir){
                copy file_syncdir to file_maindir}
            else{
                copy file_maindir to file_syncdir
            }
        }   

    else{
        add file_syncdir to global_delete_list ; 
    }






Version 2-0
-------------


    1. If found is true then we'll add the filename to the compare list 

    2. If found is false, then it either has to be deleted or copied
