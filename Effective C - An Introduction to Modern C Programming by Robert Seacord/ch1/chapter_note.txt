GETTING STARTED WITH C 

- Not much to say about this chapter
- There's a decent reference section on poratbility problems 



Language Specific

- puts will return a EOF on error and a nonnegative on success (although you should just see your message if puts was successful)

- printf will return the number of characters successfully printed (excluding null byte character) or will return a negative value if there is an error.
