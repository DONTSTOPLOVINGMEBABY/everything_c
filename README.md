<h2>everything_c Repository</h2>

<p>This repository houses random code/projects that I've written to experiment and build experience with the C programming language. I occassionally write some Python here and there when I'm looking to solve a problem quickly and want access to clean high-level functions. </p>

<h3>Effective C: An Introduction to Modern C Programming by Robert Seacord</h3>

<p>I decided to sequentially go through a proper C Programming book to further my holistic understanding of C and understand how it's taught in a standalone context. I found it to be a bit dry to read all the way through, but definitely think it serves as a solid reference with nice examples.</p>
